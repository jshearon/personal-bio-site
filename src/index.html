      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>I’ve been a small business entrepreneur for most of my working life, and always enjoyed the 
        challenges it presents. Finding creative ways to please my customers, managing teams from all 
        walks of life and bringing it all together to create a successful business is one of the most 
        rewarding things I’ve ever done. When I took a few months to learn how to code and write a 
        custom CRM for my business, I was instantly in love. Software development is the language of 
        creative problem solving I’d been searching for all along. Now I’m ready to forge a new career 
        as a developer and leverage my business experience with my newly acquired skills.</p>
